# Transition

Meeting with Keelin, Gillian (ML 2012-13) and Phil(ML 2013-14) on Monday, 25 March 2013.


## Goals

* Understand the resources available.
* General discussion on the this past year of Member Learning -- were we're at, where our current position sets us up to get to.
* Uncover some don't-know-I-don't-knows.


The Meeting
-----------

Relationships:

Nancy 

Look into rooms on second floor ARC


Increasing Membership:

hack nights: switching it up and setting up something for new members gives people a reason to come


Struggle:

balancing running repeat sessions that are great for beginners and challenging returning members.


Resources:

resources on MyEWB


re. Directors:

What is a specific role they can do?

* Library manager?
* Development beers...


Awesome Things:

* Nametags were loved, but disappeared after first semester.


Things that didn't work

* Tried to evaluate sessions, but didn't get much meaningful.
* Feedback box?
* Counted attendees -- 20-30.
* More metrics would have been good.


Original Ideas:

* photos of members, posting them on the website. <- also trying to increase website traffic.
* 1/2-page primer


Action Items:

There will be a 1/2 page "primer" to be distributed a couple times heading into next year. Send Keelin some of my ideas.


Next Time:

(see google doc)
