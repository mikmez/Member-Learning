Member-Learning
===============


My plan is to use this repository as a knowledge-store and discussion platform for Member Learning sessions next year (2013-14) at Engineers Without Borders Queen's.

As a basic rule: logistical things that have less residual value and will benefit from automated reminders go into lists of tasks on Asana (ping phil for access). Planning sessions and stuff can go here, and later serve as an archive and reference of things we've done.
