This document is a collection of ideas to guide Member Learning next year. Please tear it apart, and do not consider it static or complete or even correct. It's just ideas.


## Recruiting Grounds

* Member learning should serve as a gateway for increased involvement in QEWB.
* Posit: every workshop touches on things relevant to at least one QEWB portfolio, so make that explicit and allow people to follow up there.
* Where possible, other portfolios running sessions should provide an easy path for inspired members to jump into action with that portfolio.
* Some approaches to portfolio sessions (for inspiration only! be bold and be free!)
  * Run a session that achieves your portfolio's goal. You have 30 people at your disposal. Go nuts!
  * Back it up and challenge the goals and purposes that your portfolio is built on.


## Sneaky Growth

* Get high-profile people, or people with experience, or people studying a topic to come and run a session wherever possible.
  * Challenge the member base.
  * Attract new members that the facilitators may attract.
  * Some of the facilitators might come back!


## Feedback

* Commit to determining and collecting metrics
  * how many members came?
  * ...

* Figure out good channels of feedback
  * from the general membership
  * from ml attendees
  * from exec/directors


## Innovate on post-ML announcements

* Try new formats and iterate.
* These announcements are important! They represent direct paths for members to become more involved in the chapter! Need to make them as effective as possible.
